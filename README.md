# Phaxion

A (hopefully) small wrapper around the Phaxio API.
I would like it to support the PhaxCodes API as well.

NOTE: I have borrowed gratuitously from this gem [phaxio](https://github.com/gristmill/phaxio) so all credit goes to that author.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'phaxion'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install phaxion

## Usage

  Make the magic happen...

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
